# A Model for the Dynamics of Polarization

Implemented for Python 3.

## Dependencies

This project depends on [NumPy](https://numpy.org/index.html) (tested on 1.19.0) which may be installed from a console using pip:

```
python3 -m pip install numpy
```

Optionally, we recommend installing [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for creating graphs and charts, and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/index.html) for running simulations interactively.

```
python3 -m pip install matplotlib notebook
```

To install all dependencies you can also run:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
